# -Ping-Pong-Game-with-Turtle-Graphics
The Ping Pong Game is a simple yet engaging two-player game built using Python's Turtle Graphics library. The game allows two players to control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, with the goal of hitting the ball back and forth. The players can move their paddles up or down to intercept the ball and try to score by making the ball pass their opponent's paddle. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of event-driven programming, motion, collision detection, and game logic using Python.

The game interface features two paddles, one for Player A (red) on the left side and one for Player B (black) on the right. The ball (orange) starts in the center of the screen and bounces off the top and bottom borders, as well as the paddles. When the ball crosses a player’s side, the opponent scores a point, and the score is updated on the screen.

Key Features of the game include:

Paddle Movement: Players can control their paddles using the keyboard (W and S for Player A, Up and Down arrows for Player B).
Ball Movement: The ball continuously moves and bounces off the paddles and screen borders. If the ball hits the top or bottom edges, it rebounds in the opposite direction.
Score Tracking: The score for each player is updated each time a player misses the ball. The updated score is displayed in real-time at the top of the screen.
Collision Detection: The ball's interaction with the paddles is carefully checked to ensure it bounces back when hitting them.
This project is an excellent demonstration of Python's capabilities in creating interactive applications and games. While the game remains basic, it lays the foundation for adding more advanced features like sound effects, multiplayer functionality over a network, or advanced AI to play against the computer. It can be expanded with features such as difficulty levels, a timer, or even a graphical user interface for settings.

# Ping Pong Game with Turtle Graphics

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the **Ping Pong Game** using Python's **Turtle Graphics** library. The game features two players who control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. The goal is to prevent the ball from crossing their respective paddles while trying to score against the opponent.

The game features real-time scoring, paddle movement, ball bounce dynamics, and an interactive interface.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Players control the paddles on opposite sides using the keyboard.
- **Paddle Movement**: Player A uses the **W** and **S** keys to move the paddle up and down, while Player B uses the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: The game tracks and displays scores in real-time as players score points by making the ball pass their opponent's paddle.
- **Ball Dynamics**: The ball bounces off the paddles and screen borders, creating continuous action.
- **Game Interface**: The game is displayed in a Turtle Graphics window, with the score shown at the top.

## Installation

To run the game, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. The **Turtle** module is part of Python's standard library, so you don’t need to install anything extra.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ping-pong-game.git
   cd ping-pong-game
Open the Python script (ping_pong.py) in your preferred code editor or IDE.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
python ping_pong.py
The game window will open. You can start playing by using the following controls:

Player A: W (Up) / S (Down)
Player B: Up Arrow (Up) / Down Arrow (Down)
How to Play
Player A uses the W and S keys to control the paddle on the left side.
Player B uses the Up and Down arrow keys to control the paddle on the right side.
The goal is to hit the ball back and forth without letting it cross your side of the screen.
When the ball crosses a player's paddle, the opponent scores a point, and the game continues.
Future Improvements
This is a basic version of the Ping Pong game. Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

Sound Effects: Add sound effects when the ball bounces or a player scores a point.
AI Opponent: Implement an AI-controlled opponent that can be played against.
Leaderboard: Keep track of high scores or a multiplayer scoreboard.
Graphics Enhancements: Add more advanced graphics or animations to improve the game experience.
Difficulty Levels: Allow the ball speed and paddle sizes to vary depending on the difficulty level.
